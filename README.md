# Brawl Stars Fankit Rehosted
A rehost of (pretty much) all the assets you can find on the [Brawl Stars fankit](https://fankit.supercell.com/d/YvtsWV4pUQVm/)

# Why?
This makes it easier to include these assets in your applications (websites, etc) without hosting them yourself.
You can also download the fankit fully by downloading this repository.

# Usage
For example, you can link the `8-bit_8-bit_classic_001` asset from the `Game Assets` category of the fankit like this:

Please keep in mind that not all files may have the same filename as their title.
